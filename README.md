# tertis
## (terminal tetris)
tetris, but it's 100% in the terminal <br>

## requirements 
python 3.11 or higher.
windows only. :( yes, i have a skill issue, and no, i haven't learned since [walachat](https://github.com/sirbread/walachat) <br>
(the program interacts with mscvrt will not work on any other OS, the ANSI code parts are still very much useable and applicable for use on other terminals. someone please make a linux patch :pray:)
recommended to run windows 10 or below, since the new powershell update in 11 break ui alignment. <br>
well, unless you know how to revert to console window host.

## run ts
1. clone thy repo.  
2. run tertis.py in powershell.
no other requirements required! it's in a terminal after all.

## how to play
- [a] / [d] to move tertimono left/right
- [<] / [>] to rotate tertimono counterclockwise/clockwise
- [s] to soft drop tertimono
- [w] to hard drop tertimono
- [SPACE] to hold block
